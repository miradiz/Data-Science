    "Just a little over 40 percent of the employees that are between 50-61 years old resigned due to some type of dissatisfaction. Whereas employees between 20-50 show fairly the same numbers. In other words, regardless of age difference, 35-45% of resigned employees quit their job specifically due to some type of dissatisfaction. This could be a bit loss for a company as the percentage of resignations due to job dissatisfaction is pretty high. "
