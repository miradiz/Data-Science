    "Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",

    "A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need me to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",

    "1) What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?"
